# Hello, My name is Jeff.

### Trained in the arts of both Linux and Theology, I bring a unique perspective into any project, tackling it with incredible passion until all things are made right. I fight for the users.

#### Originally born and raised in Northeastern PA, I since moved to Lynchburg VA to study Youth Ministry. After getting my bachelor's, I began to pursue a master's degree in Discipleship, and needed a way to support myself during this time. It was then that I discovered that the skills I had been playing around with in my free time were actually quite valuable to those willing to pay.

#### From there I began to dive deep into honing my skills in IT as a Deployment Specialist I, while beginning to dive into information security on the side. I consider myself a maker of things, be they virtual or physical. I continue to grow in my skillset and further my work in a wide range of fields, trying to synthesize it in new and exciting ways.

#### Above all, I fight for the Users.
